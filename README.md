# arduino-strobe-light
Make a strobe light using an arduino. You could put LEDs directly on the output from the arduino but the low voltage won't make the light very bright. I recommend using a 12v LED panel and connecting it to the arduino using a mosphet transistor as a relay to convert the output from the arduino to 12v. 
/!\ Don't forget to put a radiator on the transistor! (I forgot to put one and it burnt
